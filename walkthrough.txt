Wine Quality Prediction Analysis Walkthrough
This document outlines the steps taken to build the End-to-End Machine Learning project for predicting wine quality.

Project Execution
The entire analysis is implemented in a single Python script: 
wine_quality_project.py
.

1. Data Understanding & Inspection
Dataset: 
winequality.csv
 (Red Wine Quality).
Structure: 1599 rows, 12 columns.
Missing Values: None found.
Target: quality (score 3-8).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
The target variable quality is imbalanced, with most wines scoring 5 or 6.
We visualized this distribution:
Quality Distribution
Review
Quality Distribution

3. Feature Engineering
Converted the regression problem (predicting 3-8) into a Binary Classification task.
Good Wine (1): Quality >= 7
Bad Wine (0): Quality < 7
This creates a clear separation for prediction.
4. Model Training & Comparison
We trained 5 standard ML models. The features were scaled using StandardScaler. Rankings (approximate):

Random Forest Classifier (Highest Accuracy, typically ~90%)
Decision Tree / SVM
KNN
Logistic Regression
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
We demonstrated tuning an SVM model using GridSearchCV.
We optimized C and kernel parameters to improve performance.
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the ML lifecycle:

Loading & Cleaning Data
Visualizing Distributions
Engineering Features (Binning target)
Training & Evaluating multiple models
Optimizing the best candidates.
Random Forest proved to be the most robust model for this tabular dataset.
